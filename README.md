# Algo-Viz

## _Work In Progress_

### The application will take user code and execute it to transform it into a visualization of the involved data structures and expressions. 

## How it works
The functionality can be broken down into high level steps.

* Accept user code
* Transform it into something that can be read
* Run the code *safely* and create a set of declarative instructions that can be used to reproduce the values and data structures from the code
* Return the instructions and use them to create a visualization

*breakdowns of these steps will come when I have a working prototype as they are subject to change*
